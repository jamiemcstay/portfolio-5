For this site I used the Noto Serif and Noto Sans Google fonts. When paired these two fonts create a balance between tradition and modernity. Noto Serif adds an authentic feel that reflects the rich history of Japanese ramen, while Noto Sans ensure readability and a clean, contemporary user experience.

#### Color

For this site I wanted I wanted to choose colors that use colors that create cohesive design. These colors are below.

-  #1C1C1C - Deep black to provide contact and depth, used for most text.
- #B71C1C - Rich red to adds bold accent to draw attention and create energy.
- #A3B763 - A muted green, creates a freshness and softens overall look.
